## FocusArchiveEntry

### Description 

Allows manipulation of entries within an archive (e.g. TAR) by focusing on one entry within the archive at a time. When an archive entry is focused, that entry is treated as the content of the FlowFile and may be manipulated independently of the rest of the archive. To restore the FlowFile to its original state, use UnfocusArchiveEntry.
