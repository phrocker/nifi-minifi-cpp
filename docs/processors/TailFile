## TailFile

### Description 

"Tails" a file, or a list of files, ingesting data from the file as it is written to the file. The file is expected to be textual. Data is ingested only when a new line is encountered (carriage return or new-line character or combination). If the file to tail is periodically "rolled over", as is generally the case with log files, an optional Rolling Filename Pattern can be used to retrieve data from files that have rolled over, even if the rollover occurred while NiFi was not running (provided that the data still exists upon restart of NiFi). It is generally advisable to set the Run Schedule to a few seconds, rather than running with the default value of 0 secs, as this Processor will consume a lot of resources if scheduled very aggressively. At this time, this Processor does not support ingesting files that have been compressed when 'rolled over'.
### Properties 

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

| Name | Default Value | Allowable Values | Description | 
| - | - | - | - | 
|File to Tail|||Fully-qualified filename of the file that should be tailed when using single file mode, or a file regex when using multifile mode|
|Input Delimiter|||Specifies the character that should be used for delimiting the data being tailedfrom the incoming file.If none is specified, data will be ingested as it becomes available.|
|State File|TailFileState||Specifies the file that should be used for storing state about what data has been ingested so that upon restart NiFi can resume from where it left off|
|tail-base-directory||||
|**tail-mode**|Single file|Single file<br>Multiple file<br>|Specifies the tail file mode. In 'Single file' mode only a single file will be watched. In 'Multiple file' mode a regex may be used. Note that in multiple file mode we will still continue to watch for rollover on the initial set of watched files. The Regex used to locate multiple files will be run during the schedule phrase. Note that if rotated files are matched by the regex, those files will be tailed.|
