## ListSFTP

### Description 

Performs a listing of the files residing on an SFTP server. For each file that is found on the remote server, a new FlowFile will be created with the filename attribute set to the name of the file on the remote server. This can then be used in conjunction with FetchSFTP in order to fetch those files.
### Properties 

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

| Name | Default Value | Allowable Values | Description | 
| - | - | - | - | 
|**Connection Timeout**|30 sec||Amount of time to wait before timing out while creating a connection|
|**Data Timeout**|30 sec||When transferring a file between the local and remote system, this value specifies how long is allowed to elapse without any data being transferred between systems|
|Entity Tracking Initial Listing Target|All Available|All Available<br>Tracking Time Window<br>|Specify how initial listing should be handled. Used by 'Tracking Entities' strategy.|
|Entity Tracking Time Window|||Specify how long this processor should track already-listed entities. 'Tracking Entities' strategy can pick any entity whose timestamp is inside the specified time window. For example, if set to '30 minutes', any entity having timestamp in recent 30 minutes will be the listing target when this processor runs. A listed entity is considered 'new/updated' and a FlowFile is emitted if one of following condition meets: 1. does not exist in the already-listed entities, 2. has newer timestamp than the cached entity, 3. has different size than the cached entity. If a cached entity's timestamp becomes older than specified time window, that entity will be removed from the cached already-listed entities. Used by 'Tracking Entities' strategy.|
|File Filter Regex|||Provides a Java Regular Expression for filtering Filenames; if a filter is supplied, only files whose names match that Regular Expression will be fetched|
|**Follow symlink**|false||If true, will pull even symbolic files and also nested symbolic subdirectories; otherwise, will not read symbolic files and will not traverse symbolic link subdirectories|
|Host Key File|||If supplied, the given file will be used as the Host Key; otherwise, no use host key file will be used|
|**Hostname**|||The fully qualified hostname or IP address of the remote system<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Http Proxy Password|||Http Proxy Password<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Http Proxy Username|||Http Proxy Username<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|**Ignore Dotted Files**|true||If true, files whose names begin with a dot (".") will be ignored|
|**Listing Strategy**|Tracking Timestamps|Tracking Entities<br>Tracking Timestamps<br>|Specify how to determine new/updated entities. See each strategy descriptions for detail.|
|Maximum File Age|||The maximum age that a file must be in order to be pulled; any file older than this amount of time (according to last modification date) will be ignored|
|Maximum File Size|||The maximum size that a file must be in order to be pulled|
|**Minimum File Age**|0 sec||The minimum age that a file must be in order to be pulled; any file younger than this amount of time (according to last modification date) will be ignored|
|**Minimum File Size**|0 B||The minimum size that a file must be in order to be pulled|
|Password|||Password for the user account<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Path Filter Regex|||When Search Recursively is true, then only subdirectories whose path matches the given Regular Expression will be scanned|
|**Port**|||The port that the remote system is listening on for file transfers<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Private Key Passphrase|||Password for the private key<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Private Key Path|||The fully qualified path to the Private Key file<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Proxy Host|||The fully qualified hostname or IP address of the proxy server<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Proxy Port|||The port of the proxy server<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|Proxy Type|DIRECT|DIRECT<br>HTTP<br>SOCKS<br>|Specifies the Proxy Configuration Controller Service to proxy network requests. If set, it supersedes proxy settings configured per component. Supported proxies: HTTP + AuthN, SOCKS + AuthN|
|Remote Path|||The fully qualified filename on the remote system<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
|**Search Recursively**|false||If true, will pull files from arbitrarily nested subdirectories; otherwise, will not traverse subdirectories|
|**Send Keep Alive On Timeout**|true||Indicates whether or not to send a single Keep Alive message when SSH socket times out|
|**State File**|ListSFTP||Specifies the file that should be used for storing state about what data has been ingested so that upon restart MiNiFi can resume from where it left off|
|**Strict Host Key Checking**|false||Indicates whether or not strict enforcement of hosts keys should be applied|
|**Target System Timestamp Precision**|Auto Detect|Auto Detect<br>Milliseconds<br>Minutes<br>Seconds<br>|Specify timestamp precision at the target system. Since this processor uses timestamp of entities to decide which should be listed, it is crucial to use the right timestamp precision.|
|**Username**|||Username<br/>**Supports Expression Language: true**|
