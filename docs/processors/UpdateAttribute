## UpdateAttribute

### Description 

This processor updates the attributes of a FlowFile using properties that are added by the user. This allows you to set default attribute changes that affect every FlowFile going through the processor, equivalent to the "basic" usage in Apache NiFi.
### Properties 

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

| Name | Default Value | Allowable Values | Description | 
| - | - | - | - | 
### Properties 

| Name | Description |
