## TFExtractTopLabels

### Description

Labels are fed as newline (`\n`) -delimited files where each line is a label
for the tensor index equivalent to the line number. Label files must be fed in

The top 5 labels are written to the following attributes:

- `top_label_0`
- `top_label_1`
- `top_label_2`
- `top_label_3`
- `top_label_4`
