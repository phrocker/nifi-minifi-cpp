### Properties 

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

| Name | Default Value | Allowable Values | Description | 
| - | - | - | - |

|Disable Directory Listing|false||If set to 'true', directory listing is not performed prior to create missing directories. By default, this processor executes a directory listing command to see target directory existence before creating missing directories. However, there are situations that you might need to disable the directory listing such as the following. Directory listing might fail with some permission setups (e.g. chmod 100) on a directory. Also, if any other SFTP client created the directory after this processor performed a listing and before a directory creation request by this processor is finished, then an error is returned because the directory already exists.|
|Dot Rename|true||If true, then the filename of the sent file is prepended with a "." and then renamed back to the original once the file is completely sent. Otherwise, there is no rename. This property is ignored if the Temporary Filename property is set.|
