## ExecuteProcess

### Description 

Runs an operating system command specified by the user and writes the output of that command to a FlowFile. If the command is expected to be long-running,the Processor can output the partial data on a specified interval. When this option is used, the output is expected to be in textual format,as it typically does not make sense to split binary data on arbitrary time-based intervals.
