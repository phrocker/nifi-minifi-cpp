## TFApplyGraph 

### Description

Applies a TensorFlow graph to the tensor protobuf supplied as input. The tensor
is fed into the node specified by the `Input Node` property. The output
FlowFile is a tensor protobuf extracted from the node specified by the `Output
Node` property.

TensorFlow graphs are read dynamically by feeding a graph protobuf to the
processor with the `tf.type` property set to `graph`.

### Properties

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other
properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any
default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

| Name | Default Value | Allowable Values | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Input Node** | | | The node of the TensorFlow graph to feed tensor inputs to |
| **Output Node** | | | The node of the TensorFlow graph to read tensor outputs from |

### Relationships

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| success | Successful graph application outputs as tensor protobufs |
| retry | Inputs which fail graph application but may work if sent again |
| failure | Failures which will not work if retried |
