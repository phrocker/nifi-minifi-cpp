## ListenHTTP

### Description 

Starts an HTTP Server and listens on a given base path to transform incoming requests into FlowFiles. The default URI of the Service will be http://{hostname}:{port}/contentListener. Only HEAD, POST, and GET requests are supported. PUT, and DELETE will result in an error and the HTTP response status code 405. The response body text for all requests, by default, is empty (length of 0). A static response body can be set for a given URI by sending input files to ListenHTTP with the http.type attribute set to response_body. The response body FlowFile filename attribute is appended to the Base Path property (separated by a /) when mapped to incoming requests. The mime.type attribute of the response body FlowFile is used for the Content-type header in responses. Response body content can be cleared by sending an empty (size 0) FlowFile for a given URI mapping.
