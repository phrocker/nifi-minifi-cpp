## ListenSyslog

### Description 

Listens for Syslog messages being sent to a given port over TCP or UDP. Incoming messages are checked against regular expressions for RFC5424 and RFC3164 formatted messages. The format of each message is: (<PRIORITY>)(VERSION )(TIMESTAMP) (HOSTNAME) (BODY) where version is optional. The timestamp can be an RFC5424 timestamp with a format of "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SZ" or "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.S+hh:mm", or it can be an RFC3164 timestamp with a format of "MMM d HH:mm:ss". If an incoming messages matches one of these patterns, the message will be parsed and the individual pieces will be placed in FlowFile attributes, with the original message in the content of the FlowFile. If an incoming message does not match one of these patterns it will not be parsed and the syslog.valid attribute will be set to false with the original message in the content of the FlowFile. Valid messages will be transferred on the success relationship, and invalid messages will be transferred on the invalid relationship.
